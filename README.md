#Syllacode
======

*SyllaCode* lets users created their own coding curriculum using their own link that they find as well as using our database of resources. 

## Background

Organizing all of your links for resources is never easy nor is learning coding in the right order of diffuculty. We decided to make an app to solve both of these problems. On this app users can make their own curriculum by storing their own links into a coding track that we provide for them.


## About SyllaCode

Syllacode lets you submit your own links which goes into our database for other users to potentially use. By impletementing drag and drop you can put these links anywhere on your coding track. Link's currently in our database are also on the side for users to use at their disgressiion.
